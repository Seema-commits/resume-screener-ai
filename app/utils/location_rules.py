"""
Deterministic location-mismatch flagging.

Same philosophy as date_utils.py: no LLM, fully inspectable. This
is intentionally a FLAG-ONLY signal ("location confirmation
required"), never an auto-reject - a resume alone can't settle
relocation willingness, visa status, or remote-work exceptions, so
a mismatch is something for a human to confirm, not disqualify on.
